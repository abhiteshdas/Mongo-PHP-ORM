Mongo-PHP-ORM
=============

Mongo PHP ORM (part of Comfi.com Homebase Framework)

* This is incarnation 2 of Homebase framework mongo ORM.
* Product is in beta. Stabilisation Stage
* It is not used in production yet.
* It still depends on some Homebase framework classes and functions

DESCRIPTION
===========
Mongo-PHP-ORM is standalone `not yet` php framework.


# Key Features
* simple **compact** clutter-less **syntax**
* maps mongo records to objects
* you can extend this objects
  * add methods, ( getters, setters ), calculated fields
* keep your business logic inside your objects
* lots of useful functions and shortcuts
  * group by, mix/max/avg/sum/...
  * index enforcement, mysql migration
* **relation** support (has_one, has_many)
* field **aliases** ( long keys be unnessecary burden for bson based storage)
* **type support** 
  * basic and complex types (name, ip, phone, email, url, ...)
  * you can extend/overload our classes
* declarative and easy to support config
  * configure autoload fields, in-memory entity caching
* almost no overhead, written with performance in mind

# DETAILS
* All our primary keys are ints. 
    We do not like mongo primary keys, we use our sequence generator. Speed is good enough. For batch jobs we reserve blocks of IDs.
* Several Layers of Abstraction:
  * Mongo Wrapper (M_Collection)
    * adds new shortcut functions, simlification of existing mongo functions
  * M_TypedCollection
    * type support for mongo, supports basic and complex/custom classes
  * M_Object
    * default implementation / base class for your objects
    * you may extend it or use default implementation
  * M_Type
    * type support. int, string, float, date, datetime, ip, email, url, array, arrays_of
    * allows you to define applyType method (used before save and before lookups)
    * provides magic fields:
       * alternative field getter / setter
       * ex. by default date fields stored as ints, by accessing magic field "_datefield" youll get human format "May 25, 2012"
